    <h1>Post Impressionism</h1>
    <p>Using simplified colours and difinitive forms, post impressionism aimed to 
        express emotions and themes instead of the optical impression that was the 
        focus in the previous impressionism movement.</p>

    <h2>Famous Artist From the Movement</h2>
    <h3>Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
    <p id="artist"><i>1853-1890</i>
    Born in the Netherlands Van Gogh was one of the most iconcic artists of the post impressionism movement
    having made over 2000 pieces of art in his lifetime. Despite this he was not financially successful during his lifetime
    relying on his brother for finnancial aid, partly because many regarded him as a mardman due to his severe depression, pyscotic episodes and 
    delusions whick eventually led to his suicide by shotgun. </p>

    <h3>Georges Seurat</h3>
    <p id="artist"><i>1859-1891</i>
    Growing up in Paris Seurat was one of the leaders of the post impressionism movements devising techniques such as chromolunarism and pointilism. He had two
    children with artist model Madeleine Knobloch who's relationship with was concealed. The first was born in 1890 but died two weeks after Seurat did of an unknown disease that killed
    both the artist and his first son. His second child was born after his death but died during birth. Rather than focusing on fleeting moments and instead focus on the aspects of life that are unchanging such as urban leasuire 
    which can be seen in his more prominent works 'Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte'</p>

    <h3>Paul Cézanne</h3>
    <p id="artist"><i>1839-1906</i> Cézanne began learning to paint in 1860 in his birthtown Aix-en-Provence later moving to Paris. His early works were in the style of romantic and classical while his later works are generally classified as post impressionism.
    His unique method of building colour and analytical approach helped influence Cubism and Fauves. While he had a small following of collectors during his life it wasn't untill a post-humerous exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune and the Salon d’Automne in 1907 in 1907 that Cézanne popularity grew and his 
    legacy as an artist was established.</p>
