    <h2>Famous Artist From the Movement</h2>
    <h3>Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
    <p id="artist"><i>1853-1890</i>
    Born in the Netherlands Van Gogh was one of the most iconcic artists of the post impressionism movement
    having made over 2000 pieces of art in his lifetime. Despite this he was not financially successful during his lifetime
    relying on his brother for finnancial aid, partly because many regarded him as a mardman due to his severe depression, pyscotic episodes and 
    delusions whick eventually led to his suicide by shotgun. </p>
